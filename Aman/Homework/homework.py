"""1. Write a Python program to calculate the length of a string.

2. Write a Python program to count the number of characters (character
frequency) in a string.
Sample String : google.com'
Expected Result : {'o': 3, 'g': 2, '.': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 1, 'm': 1, 'c': 1}

3. Write a Python program to get a string made of the first 2 and the last 2 chars
from a given a string. If the string length is less than 2, return instead of the
empty string.
Sample String : 'w3resource'
Expected Result : 'w3ce'
Sample String : 'w3'
Expected Result : 'w3w3'
Sample String : ' w'
Expected Result : Empty String
4. Write a Python program to get a string from a given string where all

occurrences of its first char have been changed to '$', except the first char
itself. Sample String : 'restart'
Expected Result : 'resta$t'

5. Write a Python program to get a single string from two given strings, separated
by a space and swap the first two characters of each string
Sample String : 'abc', 'xyz'
Expected Result : 'xyc abz'



6. Write a Python program to add 'ing' at the end of a given string (length should
be at least 3). If the given string already ends with 'ing' then add 'ly' instead. If the
string length of the given string is less than 3, leave it unchanged. Sample String
: 'abc'
www.tenbyten.io
Expected Result : 'abcing'
Sample String : 'string'
Expected Result : 'stringly'

7. Write a Python program to find the first appearance of the substring 'not' and
'poor' from a given string, if 'not' follows the 'poor', replace the whole 'not'..
.'poor'substring with 'good'. Return the resulting string.
Sample String : 'The lyrics is not that poor!'
'The lyrics is poor!'
Expected Result : 'The lyrics is good!'
'The lyrics is poor!'

8. Write a Python function that takes a list of words and returns the length of the
longest one.

9. Write a Python program to remove the nth index character from a nonempty
string.

10. Write a Python program to change a given string to a new string where the
first and last chars have been exchanged

11. Write a Python program to remove the characters which have odd index
values of a given string

12. Write a Python program to count the occurrences of each word in a given
sentence.

13. Write a Python script that takes input from the user and displays that input
back in upper and lower case

14. Write a Python program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words
as input and prints the unique words in sorted form (alphanumerically). Sample
Words : red, white, black, red, green, black
Expected Result : black, green, red, white,red"""
